This repository is set up as a monorepo, 
meaning that the client and backend projects are in one repository. 
This allows you to open both projects in the same editor.

1. fork and clone code from git hub
2. install and run (npm install npm start)

3. create Heroku folder for backend and client ( folders in heroku must be unique)

$ heroku create name-generator-backend-MNT

$ heroku create name-generator-client-MNT

4. Use git remote add to add the Heroku Git repos 

	git remote add heroku-backend https://git.heroku.com/name-generator-backend-MNT.git
	
	git remote add heroku-client https://git.heroku.com/name-generator-client-MNT.git
	
5. add and commit the code
	git add .
	git commit -m "first commit"
	
Because you are using two different repositories in your project, 
you need to push your changes using the subtree command. 
The subtree command allows you to nest one or more repositories inside another as a subdirectory. 
In short,this command allows you to manage multiple repositories in one; 
it's commonly used in monorepo projects.

6. git subtree push --prefix backend heroku-backend main
	git subtree push --prefix client heroku-client main
	
7. To see your deployed app, use heroku open with the -a flag to indicate the app that you want to open.
heroku open -a name-generator-client
