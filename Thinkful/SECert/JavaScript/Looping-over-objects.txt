transforming objects into arrays
In this context, "cheating" means that instead of looping over an object, you'll actually transform part of the object into an array.
There are two methods that allow you to "cheat" in this way: Object.values() and Object.keys().
Often, you'll use objects to connect two pieces of information together. For example, the following object connects names with addresses.

const people = {
  "Lee Finch": { address: "913 Hunts Lane", isCustomer: true },
  "Whitney Shawna": { address: "392 Norfolk Street", isCustomer: false },
  "Gabrielle Mayo": { address: "934 Engert Avenue", isCustomer: false },
};

Access Values

const addresses = Object.values(people);
//> [
//>   { address: "913 Hunts Lane", isCustomer: true },
//>   { address: "392 Norfolk Street", isCustomer: false },
//>   { address: "934 Engert Avenue", isCustomer: false },
//> ]

Access Keys
For/IN Loop to loop through an object on its own
for (let name in people) {
  const person = people[name];
  const address = person.address;
  console.log(`Sending mail to ${name} at ${address}.`);
}
