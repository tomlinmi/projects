example of reduce function like -> 






const parkToAreasObject = parks.reduce((result, park) => { result[park.name] = park.areaInSquareKm; return result; }, {});

Here you can see we are passing the empty object to our reduce function as initial value, that is assign to the result variable.

And we are modify the result in the callback function, so we need to return the modifeded result.

Example for assessment 10.2

const result = books.reduce((popularBooks, book) => {popularBooks.push({ name: book.title, count: book.borrows.length}); return popularBooks },[]);
  
result.sort((objA, objB) => objB.count - objA.count);
return result.slice(0,5)
}
