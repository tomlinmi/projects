LEFT JOIN
A LEFT JOIN brings back all rows on the left side of a join, even if it doesn't match any rows on the right.
If no matches are found, the right-side columns are returned with NULL values.

Example
List all department names at Thinkful Books and their corresponding managers

SELECT
  d.department_id AS id,
  d.department_name AS department,
  e.first_name AS manager_first_name,
  e.last_name AS manager_last_name
FROM
  departments d
  LEFT JOIN -- Specify `LEFT JOIN` here
  employees e
  ON d.manager = e.employee_id;

Right Join
  
List all Thinkful Books employee names and the name of the department that they manage
List all employee regardless of whether they manage a department
RIGHT JOIN is the same as changing the order of the tables listed in a LEFT JOIN.

SELECT
  e.first_name AS manager_first_name,
  e.last_name AS manager_last_name,
  d.department_id AS id,
  d.department_name AS department
FROM
  departments d
  RIGHT JOIN -- Specify `RIGHT JOIN` as the clause
  employees e
  ON d.manager = e.employee_id;
  
FULL JOIN
  
  The FULL JOIN keyword returns all rows when there is a match in the left table (the departments table in this case) or right table (the employees table in this case) records.
  
  List all departments and all employees at Thinkful Books

  d.department_id AS id,
  d.department_name AS department,
  e.first_name,
  e.last_name
FROM
  departments d
  FULL JOIN -- Specify `FULL JOIN` here
  employees e
  on d.manager = e.employee_id;
