2. Connect to DB with DBeaver app (host = server, DB&Default database, copy password)
3. rightclick DB connect on DBeaver and rename the database connection to match instance (development)
4. select the DB and expand public (all new objects default to public)
5. Open SQL editor, run SQL
6. Save and F5 to refresh table_name

Update

UPDATE table_name
SET column_name_1 = <value_1>,
    column_name_n = <value_n>;
	
	
DEFAULT value
example 
set fax to default

UPDATE employees
SET fax = DEFAULT;

Update certain rows (Restrict)

UPDATE table_name
SET column_name_1 = <value_1>,
    column_name_n = <value_n>
WHERE <conditions>;

example - all of the employees that reported to Willie Lyons will now report to  Fibber McGee.

UPDATE employees
SET reports_to = 'Fibber McGee'

============================================================
Deleting Data without deleting table itself.  use Truncate for delete all data in table

DELETE FROM <table_name>
WHERE <conditions>


VP of Sales job were entered as employees, but only the VP of Sales reporting to Adele Gonzalez was actually hired.

test where clause before delete
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE job_title = 'VP Sales' AND reports_to <> 'Adele Gonzalez';

change SELECT * to DELETE

DELETE FROM employees
WHERE job_title = 'VP Sales' AND reports_to <> 'Adele Gonzalez';

==================================
Clearing all the data at once
TRUNCATE

TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>;

TRUNCATE multiple tables
TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name_1>, <table_name_2>, â€¦;
